  # This is the list of services and containers that make our application

    # Maps ports from Host -> Container
    # Here we hap host 8787 to container 8787.
    # Within the container RStudio runs on Port 8787
    ports:

    # Environment info
    # Many docker projects do configuration through environment variables
    # because they are easy to change and require no local copies like files
    # 
    # Here we are configuring some option for the base image RStudio
    # Like the password and the User
    environment:
      - "PASSWORD=test"
      - "USERID=${UID:-1000}"
      #- "USER=rstudio"
    # Here we map host volumes to container volumes
    #
    # Notice in this compose we map in scripts and data even though
    # we added them in our dockerfile
    # This allows us to modify the script/data and run inside the container
    # and test new data or make changes to the script itself
    volumes:
      - ./data:/home/rstudio/r-docker-workshop/data
      - ./output:/home/rstudio/r-docker-workshop/output
      - ./scripts:/home/rstudio/r-docker-workshop/scripts
